# Code of Conduct

## Our Mission

SHALE YEAH exists to democratize oil & gas decision-making by breaking down the walls that lock out small operators, independents, and field pros. We're building tools for doers, not committees.

## Our Values

**Open by Default**: No black boxes, no vendor lock-in, no subscription walls.

**Built for Builders**: Every feature serves people who get work done, not people who schedule meetings about work.

**Respectful Disruption**: We're here to change an industry, but we do it with respect for each other and the work we're all trying to do.

## Expected Behavior

- **Be Direct**: Say what you mean. Skip the corporate speak.
- **Be Helpful**: If someone's stuck, help them get unstuck.
- **Be Open**: Share knowledge, code, and techniques freely.
- **Be Professional**: Attack problems, not people.

## Unacceptable Behavior

- Harassment, discrimination, or hostile behavior of any kind
- Publishing proprietary data or trade secrets
- Spam, trolling, or deliberate disruption
- Anything that violates our open-source mission

## Enforcement

Issues should be reported to: conduct@ascendvent.com

We'll respond within 72 hours and take appropriate action to maintain our community standards.

## The Bottom Line

We're here to build something better than what exists. If that's your goal too, welcome aboard.
