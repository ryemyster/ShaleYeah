# Research-Hub Execution Plan

## Target Research: Splunk HEC Integration

**Objective**: Create RFC for Splunk HTTP Event Collector integration to enable SHALE YEAH telemetry and monitoring

**Why This First**: 
- High enterprise adoption
- Well-documented API  
- Immediate operational value
- Validates our research → RFC → implementation pipeline

## Research Tasks

1. **Splunk HEC API Documentation**
   - Authentication methods (HEC tokens)
   - Event format and schema requirements
   - Rate limits and best practices
   - Error handling and retry logic

2. **Integration Pattern Analysis**
   - Common oil & gas use cases for Splunk
   - Event payload structures for geological data
   - Dashboard and alert examples
   - Security and compliance considerations

3. **Implementation Planning**
   - TypeScript/Node.js integration approach
   - Environment variable configuration
   - Error handling and logging
   - Testing and validation methods

## Expected RFC Output

`research/rfcs/splunk-hec-integration.md` with:
- API documentation and examples
- Authentication setup guidance  
- Sample event payloads for SHALE YEAH data
- Complete implementation roadmap

## Success Criteria

- RFC enables immediate Splunk integration development
- Includes working code examples
- Documents security best practices
- Provides clear testing methodology
