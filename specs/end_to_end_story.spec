SHALE YEAH – End-to-End Story & Agent Flow

🧭 Story Overview

This is the narrative of how SHALE YEAH agents collaborate like a real team of upstream professionals — moving from land evaluation to executed deal to live asset monitoring.

⸻

🧑‍🔬 GEO – The Geologist (GeoWiz)

GEO receives a new tract shapefile from a field scout. They drag it into the system. GeoWiz processes the file, overlays it with public formations, and outputs:
	•	A quality score (85/100) for the Wolfcamp B
	•	A colored DSU overlay map
	•	Notes: “Shallower than ideal, but high lateral density potential.”

GEO hands the results to Eco.

⸻

🧮 ECO – The Deal Valuation Analyst (EconoBot)

ECO takes the zones.geojson and calls DrillCast to simulate:
	•	6 wells expected over 4 years
	•	Type curve with 1.7 Bcf EUR

Then ECO runs valuation:
	•	Inputs oil/gas deck, CAPEX, and royalty
	•	Outputs NPV: $2.8M
	•	Recommended PPA: $6,250/acre

Sends numbers to RISK.

⸻

🔎 RISK – The Risk Scorer (RiskRanger)

RISK scores across categories:
	•	Title complexity: medium
	•	Geology: strong
	•	Timing: moderate confidence

Final risk score: 32% → “Proceed with caution.”

Passes it to CORE.

⸻

🧠 CORE – The Decider (The Core)

CORE has all the data:
	•	NPV = $2.8M
	•	Risk = 32%
	•	PPA = $6,250

Logic matches thresholds → greenlights LOI
Triggers NotaryBot.

⸻

✍️ SANDMAN – The Deal Closer (NotaryBot)

SANDMAN pulls the contact info and:
	•	Generates a Markdown LOI
	•	Converts to PDF
	•	Logs the file + sends to broker

Also updates the system log for reporting.

⸻

🧾 WRITER – The Report Agent (Reporter)

WRITER gathers all outputs:
	•	Geology summary, valuation chart, risk table, LOI

Creates:
	•	SHALE_YEAH_REPORT.md
	•	SHALE_YEAH_REPORT.pdf

Drops them to /output/${RUN_ID}/

⸻

🛰️ OP – The Asset Monitor (PulseRig)

Months later, production begins.
OP checks production logs weekly:
	•	Actual: 10% under forecast
	•	Variance sustained for 2 months

Triggers an alert + suggests revaluation.

⸻

🧪 RESEARCHER – The Explorer (ResearchHub)

Back at HQ, RESEARCHER is tasked to expand into a new region.
They input: “Surpac + Datamine compatibility”
Outputs:
	•	RFC on Surpac APIs
	•	2 vendor links + auth model
	•	Suggests new agent: surpac-ingest

⸻

🧱 BUILDER – The Integrator (AgentForge)

BUILDER takes the RFC and builds:
	•	agents/surpac-ingest.yaml
	•	Validates the structure + adds a stub to the repo

Deployment team plugs it into the workflow.

⸻

✅ The Business Outcome
	1.	Tract evaluated
	2.	LOI issued
	3.	Report archived
	4.	Asset monitored
	5.	Workflow expanded

No platform. No vendor. No waiting.
Just code + agents + clear action.
