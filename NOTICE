IP INDEPENDENCE STATEMENT

SHALE YEAH was created independently and from first principles. 
It is not affiliated with, endorsed by or derivative any third-party oil & gas investment firm.

This project contains no proprietary source code, business logic, trade secrets or confidential material from any other entity. 
All components â€” including agents, workflows, data structures and economic models were designed 
ecifically to support an open-source platform aimed at democratizing access to 
oil & gas deal evaluation, execution and reporting.

Where common terms or legacy formats (e.g. .mdb, ARIES, Spotfire) are mentioned they are used in a generic, standards-based context only.

This project exists to empower the public to build and operate better upstream workflows using transparent agent-based infrastructure.
