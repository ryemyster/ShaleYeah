# SHALE YEAH Implementation Plan

**Project Vision:** Open-source, agent-powered AI platform for oil & gas land analysis, valuation, and deal execution.

**Goal:** Democratize upstream decision-making through modular, hackable agents that work for individuals, not just institutions.

## ðŸŽ¯ Definition of Done

### Minimum Viable Demo
- [ ] `bash scripts/demo.sh` runs clean and produces `SHALE_YEAH_REPORT.md` with footer
- [ ] curve-smith emits `curves/*.csv` and `qc_report.md` with RMSE and NRMSE
- [ ] research-hub generates at least one RFC with two citations
- [ ] agent-forge creates syntactically valid agent YAML from RFC
- [ ] CI passes on first run (CodeQL, Gitleaks)
- [ ] No secrets committed to repository
- [ ] README instructions work on clean machine

### Quality Gates
- [ ] **geowiz**: zones.geojson must declare depth units
- [ ] **curve-smith**: qc_report.md must include per-curve RMSE and NRMSE
- [ ] **reporter**: include data provenance with file paths and counts
- [ ] **research-hub**: include two or more URLs and PoC plan
- [ ] **agent-forge**: generated agent YAML must parse and include outputs

## ðŸ”§ Current Status

**Wave 1**: âœ… 100% complete (foundation ready for disruption!)
**Wave 2**: ~20% complete (basic structure, need agent logic)
**Wave 3**: ~0% complete (all integration stubs needed)
**Wave 4**: âœ… 100% complete (CI/CD, security, and documentation ready!)
**Wave 5**: ~0% complete (future features)

---

## ðŸš€ Next Actions

1. **Complete Wave 1** - Finish foundation files and demo data
2. **Build Wave 2** - Implement core pipeline and agent logic
3. **Test end-to-end** - Verify demo.sh works completely
4. **Add integrations** - Build out Wave 3 stubs
5. **Secure and document** - Complete Wave 4 CI/CD
