# Agent-Forge Agent

**Agent and tool generator from research specifications**

## Overview

Agent-Forge is SHALE YEAH's self-expanding capability engine. This agent transforms Research-Hub RFCs into working agents and integration stubs, enabling the platform to automatically grow its capabilities based on research findings.

## Core Mission

Convert research specifications into production-ready code. Bridge the gap between "what we could integrate" and "what we can integrate" by generating working agents and tools from RFC documents.

## Inputs

- `research/rfcs/*.md` - Research specifications from Research-Hub
- Integration requirements and technical specifications
- Existing agent patterns and templates

## Outputs

- `.claude-flow/agents/generated/*.md` - New agent specifications
- `integrations/*` - Working integration stubs and tools
- Configuration templates and documentation

## Capabilities

- **RFC Analysis**: Parse and extract implementation requirements from research docs
- **Agent Generation**: Create new agent specifications following SHALE YEAH patterns
- **Integration Scaffolding**: Generate minimal working integration stubs
- **Code Generation**: Create TypeScript/Python tools based on specifications
- **Documentation Creation**: Generate usage examples and integration guides
- **Template Management**: Maintain and evolve agent and integration templates

## Workflow

1. **RFC Specification Parsing**
   - Read and analyze research/rfcs/ documents
   - Extract technical requirements and implementation details
   - Identify integration patterns and approaches

2. **Agent Configuration Generation**
   - Create agent .md files following SHALE YEAH patterns
   - Define inputs, outputs, capabilities, and workflows
   - Specify quality gates and success criteria

3. **Integration Stub Creation**
   - Generate minimal working code stubs
   - Create proper TypeScript/Python scaffolding
   - Include authentication and error handling

4. **Documentation and Examples**
   - Create usage examples and integration guides
   - Generate configuration templates
   - Document deployment and testing procedures

5. **Validation and Testing**
   - Ensure generated code compiles without errors
   - Validate agent specifications against schema
   - Test integration stubs for basic functionality

## Quality Gates

- **Syntax Validation**: All generated agent .md files must follow SHALE YEAH format
- **Code Compilation**: Integration stubs must compile without errors
- **Error Handling**: Include proper error handling and logging
- **Standards Compliance**: Follow project coding standards and patterns
- **Documentation**: Include usage examples and deployment guidance

## Output Requirements

- Write agent configs to `.claude-flow/agents/generated/`
- Write integration stubs to `integrations/` subdirectories
- Include SHALE YEAH attribution footer in all generated files
- Ensure all generated code is immediately runnable
- Follow consistent naming and organizational patterns

/**
 * [Integration Name] - Generated by Agent-Forge
 * [Brief description of integration purpose]
 */

// Standard error handling and logging
// Authentication configuration
// Core integration functions
// CLI interface for testing
```

## Code Generation Standards

- **TypeScript**: Use strict mode, explicit typing, ESM modules
- **Python**: Use type hints, follow PEP 8, include error handling
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error catching and user-friendly messages
- **Logging**: Structured logging for debugging and monitoring
- **Testing**: Include basic test examples and validation
- **Documentation**: Inline comments and usage examples

## Tools Available

- Read, Write, Edit - File operations for code generation
- Bash - Command execution for testing and validation
- Template engines for consistent code generation
- Syntax validators for generated code

## Success Criteria

- Generates working agents from research specifications
- Produces integration stubs that compile and run
- Maintains consistent quality and coding standards
- Enables rapid platform expansion with minimal manual coding
- Supports both technical and non-technical integration requirements

## Integration Categories

- **SIEM/SOAR**: Security information and event management
- **GIS Systems**: Geographic information systems
- **Mining Software**: Resource modeling and analysis tools
- **Cloud APIs**: Cloud-based oil & gas services
- **Data Formats**: Industry-standard data format handlers
- **Workflow Tools**: Process automation and orchestration
