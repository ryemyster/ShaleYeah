## Next Steps

Based on the analysis completed, the following actions are recommended:

### Immediate Actions
1. **Review geological interpretation** - Validate formation boundaries and lithology assignments
2. **Assess data quality** - Address any curve quality issues identified in QC analysis
3. **Validate spatial extent** - Confirm geological zones align with tract boundaries

### Development Planning
1. **Drilling target identification** - Select optimal well locations within productive zones
2. **Completion design** - Plan fracture stimulation based on formation characteristics
3. **Economic modeling** - Integrate geological and completion parameters for financial analysis

### Data Enhancement Opportunities
1. **Additional well logs** - Consider acquiring density, resistivity, or image logs if missing
2. **Seismic integration** - Incorporate 3D seismic data for structural interpretation if available
3. **Regional correlation** - Compare results with nearby wells for geological validation

### Risk Assessment
1. **Technical risks** - Evaluate geological uncertainty and drilling hazards
2. **Economic risks** - Model sensitivity to commodity prices and development costs  
3. **Operational risks** - Assess regulatory, environmental, and logistical factors
