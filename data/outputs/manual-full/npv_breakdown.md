## Economic Model Methodology

The SHALE YEAH economic model follows industry-standard DCF (Discounted Cash Flow) methodology:

```
Revenue = Monthly_Prod * Strip_Price * NRI
OpCost = Monthly_Prod * LOE  
CashFlow = Revenue - OpCost
NPV = sum(CashFlow_t / (1 + r)^t) - CapEx
```

### Key Assumptions

| Discount Rate | 10.0% | Industry standard |
| NRI | 60.0% | Ownership analysis |
