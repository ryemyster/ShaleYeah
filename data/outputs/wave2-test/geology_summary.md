## Formation Analysis

| Formation | Top (ft) | Bottom (ft) | Thickness (ft) | Lithology | Confidence | Porosity | Permeability |
|-----------|----------|-------------|----------------|-----------|------------|----------|--------------|
| Wolfcamp A | 0 | 150 | 150 | Shale/Limestone | 0.70 | 0.080 | 0.000100 |
| Wolfcamp B | 150 | 350 | 200 | Shale/Sandstone | 0.70 | 0.100 | 0.000200 |
| Bone Spring | 350 | 650 | 300 | Limestone/Sandstone | 0.70 | 0.120 | 0.000500 |

## Key Insights

- **Total Productive Thickness:** 650 ft
- **Average Confidence Level:** 0.70
- **Primary Lithology:** Shale/Limestone
- **Depth Range:** 0 - 650 ft

## Data Quality Assessment

- **Curves Available:** None
- **Log Quality:** Limited

## Recommendations

- Consider additional log analysis or formation evaluation before proceeding
